# interbotix_xslocobot_nav

## Overview
This package configures the ROS Navigation Stack needed to give any X-Series Interbotix Locobot platform the ability to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (a.k.a SLAM), navigation, or just localization. It can be used with just the [Intel RealSense D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/) camera or with both the camera and the [A2M8 RPLidar](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2) laser scanner. The localization and mapping part is done using the [rtabmap_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros) ROS package while the navigation part is accomplished via the [move_base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) ROS package. For best results, this package should be run with the robot in an indoor, uncluttered environment that does not contain too much sunlight and has minimal reflective surfaces.

## Structure
![xslocobot_nav_flowchart](images/xslocobot_nav_flowchart.png)
As shown above, this package builds on top of the *interbotix_xslocobot_control* package (which starts the **xs_sdk** node), and is used in conjunction with the *rtabmap_ros* and *move_base* ROS packages. A short description of the nodes needed from those packages can be found below:
- **rostopic** - used to publish the desired tilt angle for the RealSense camera at startup
- **rtabmapviz** - Rtabmap's Visualization tool when doing mapping or localization; not really necessary to use since Rtabmap has Rviz plugins that work pretty well
- **move_base** - responsible for planning paths for the robot and sending Twist commands to the Kobuki base to follow them
- **rtabmap** - responsible for performing SLAM or just localization

Note that there are also a few Rtabmap nodelets that are started up under the *realsense2_camera_manager* for processing purposes. Descriptions of them are below:
- **rtabmap_ros/rgbd_sync** - synchronizes color and depth images from the Realsense camera, and outputs an RGBD image; this is used by the nodelet below and the main **rtabmap** node to do SLAM or localization
- **rtabmap_ros/point_cloud_xyzrgb** - takes in RGBD images, decimates them (to reduce noise and processing requirements), and outputs PointCloud2 messages to the nodelet below
- **rtabmap_ros/obstacles_detection** - takes in PointCloud2 messages and filters out the ground; then it outputs the resulting PointCloud2 to `depth/color/obstacles`. This is in turn used by `move_base` to avoid obstacles

## Usage
There are three ways this package can be used. One way is to build a map from scratch and have the robot perform SLAM. A second way is to load a pre-built map and continue SLAM. Finally, a third way is to load a pre-built map and just do localization. Note that the commands below assume the user has a Locobot WidowX 200 robot with the lidar add-on. However, any X-Series Locobot will work. If no lidar is being used, make sure the `use_lidar` argument is set to `false`.

#### SLAM From Scratch
To get SLAM up and running from scratch, type the following in a terminal on the robot computer:
```
$ roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_nav xslocobot_nav.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx200 use_lidar:=true rtabmap_args:=-d
```

The above command will delete the current database (by default - stored at `~/.ros/rtabmap.db`) and create a new one. The database stores map cloud and graph data (see the ROS Wiki for info on these concepts) which it then uses at run time to create a 2D map that move_base can use.

Once the Nav Stack is running, you should see info messages appearing in the terminal once a second saying something similar to...
```
rtabmap (3): Rate=1.00s, Limit=0.000s, RTAB-Map=0.0697s, Maps update=0.0099s pub=0.0000s (local map=1, WM=1)
```

Now, to visualize the robot in Rviz, run the following on your personal Linux computer (note that you should first run the remote installation script on your personal computer if you haven't done so already):
```
$ roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_descriptions remote_view.launch rviz_frame:=map
```

Rviz should now open up looking like the picture below:
<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="auto" src="images/rviz_start.png">
</p>

To visualize the map being created, just click the checkbox by the **Map** display. To see a live color feed as well as filtered point cloud data from the RealSense camera, click the **Camera** display. Note that move_base uses this filtered point cloud data to detect obstacles in the robot's path. It is filtered to reduce bandwidth and to segment out the floor so that the robot doesn't think the 'floor is lava' so-to-speak :). On the other hand, rtabmap_ros uses both the live feed and an aligned depth feed (not displayed) to perform mapping and localization. Next, click the **LaserScan** display to show a 360 degree view of where it thinks there are obstacles. This is used both by move_base for obstacle dectection and rtabmap_ros for mapping and localization refinement. Moving on, the **RtabmapRos** display can be used to show a point-cloud representation of the robot's environment built in real-time as the robot moves. See the picture below for a visualization of all these displays in Rviz.

</p>

At this point, you're ready to start moving the robot. There are three ways to do this. One is to use the `2D Nav Goal` button at the the top of the Rviz screen to set a goal pose within the map's free space. This sends a command to move_base to plan out and execute a path to the goal. A second way is to run the `xslocobot_joy.launch` file found in the *interbotix_xslocobot_joy* ROS package (either on the robot or on your remote computer). To do this, type...
```
roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_joy xslocobot_joy.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx200 launch_driver:=false
```
Setting the `launch_driver` argument to `false` tells the launch file not to startup the locobot driver nodes as the robot is already running. Finally, a third way to move the robot is to run the Kobuki **keyop** node. This will then allow you to use your keyboard arrow keys to move the robot. To do this, type the following either on the robot or remote computer...
```
roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch __ns:=locobot
```
Note the two underscores before the *ns* launch file tag.
 Also note that only one of these control modes should be used at a time; otherwise, the base might not move correctly (as it's being bombarded with different velocity commands from multiple packages simultaneously).

My recommendation is to use a PS4 controller when doing mapping or SLAM since that gives you full control on the robot's motion and is more intuitive to use than the keyboard. Some other tips to get a clean point cloud map are:
- Rotate the robot full circle slowly to get as many features as possible so that the algorithm has a higher chance of getting loop closures
- After rotating in a single spot, slowly translate over to another spot, and do another full circle. Repeat this and the above step multiple times until you've mapped your desired area
- In the **RtabmapROS** Rviz display, open up the **MapCloud** display, and raise the `Cloud decimation` level to 6 or 8 (default is 4). This will filter out more of the raw point cloud data, reducing noise
- Also in the **RtabmapROS** Rviz display, open the **MapCloud** display, and lower the `Cloud max depth` level to 2 (default is 4). This will only stitch point cloud data up to 2 meters away from the robot together. As depth readings tends to degrade the further away they are from the sensor, this will also filter out noisy data.
- Try not to map out areas that are already mapped out more than once to reduce noise; also this will keep the size of the resulting database smaller; these files can be rather large (a few hundred Megabytes)!!
- For optimal loop closure detection, it's a good idea that the depth camera be tilted to the same angle that it will be tilted at when just doing localization; during localization, it's a good idea to have the camera tilted down slightly so that small obstacles that can't be seen by the laser scanner can be picked up.

After mapping, you should have a MapCloud similar in structure to the one below. If that's the case, type `Ctrl-C` in the robot's terminal to stop the launch file. Then close out Rviz on your remote computer as well.

#### Continuing SLAM From a Pre-Built Map
To continue doing SLAM, type the following in a terminal on the robot computer:
```
roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_nav xslocobot_nav.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx200 use_lidar:=true rtabmap_args:='--Rtabmap/StartNewMapOnLoopClosure true'
```

Setting the `Rtabmap/StartNewMapOnLoopClosure` parameter to `true` tells Rtabmap to wait on starting a new map until it detects a loop closure with the old map. If you'd rather have Rtabmap start creating a new map right away before finding loop closures (perhaps you're mapping a different part of your office that's not next to the first part), then set the parameter to `false` (which it should be by default).

As far as visualizing the robot in Rviz and controlling it are concerned, just look at the tips in the **SLAM From Scratch** section above.

#### Localization
Once you've finished mapping your desired environment, the next step is to have the robot uses its sensors to just localize itself within the map while navigating. To do so, type the following in a terminal on the robot computer:
```
roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_nav xslocobot_nav.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx200 use_lidar:=true localization:=true
```
Next, open up Rviz on your remote computer as outlined in the **SLAM From Scratch** section, and visualize the **Map** display. You should see something similar in structure to the picture below (of course your office layout will be different).

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="auto" src="images/map_2d_view.png">
</p>

Now check the **Move Base** Rviz display. This should display both the global and local costmaps. In general, a costmap associates obstacles with high cost values (100), areas near obstacles with slightly lower values (from 1 - 99), and free space as 0. These costmaps are then used to do path planning where the main objective is to find a path that has minimal cost. For the map above (generated from Rtabmap), the global costmap looks like...

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="auto" src="images/global_costmap.png">
</p>

As can be seen, it's pretty colorful! Each color is associated with a cost. The color that lines up with the black part in the original map represents true obstacles and signifies the highest cost (the light purple color surrounded by cyan in this case). As you move outward, each color signifies a slightly lower cost.

In this case, the global costmap is made up of three layers. The first one is the static map layer which is essentially the map created by Rtabmap. The second one is the Obstacle layer. Any obstacles picked up by the robot's sensors not seen in the original static map are added in this layer. The final one is the Inflation layer. As its name suggests, all obstacles are inflated a bit to prevent the robot from navigating too close to obstacles.

The local costmap on the other hand is made up of two layers and is a lot smaller (a 4 meter square area centered around the robot). It just contains the Obstacle layer and the inflation layer. A picture of it can be seen below.

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="auto" src="images/local_costmap.png">
</p>

Besides for the Costmap sub-displays in the **Move Base** group, there are also the Global and Local Plan displays. Whenever a 2D Nav Goal is set in Rviz, a global path (in green) is displayed linking the goal state with the start state. This path is the overall path the robot will try to follow. Similarly, a local plan (in red) is also displayed that starts from the robot's footprint and goes for about a meter. The local plan attempts to follow the global path but will take detours if obstacles get in the way.

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" height="auto" src="images/path_planning.png">
</p>

As an FYI, when starting in localization mode, Rtabmap will try to localize the robot using its last known position (from a previous session) as a reference point. Most of the time, it's able to figure out where the robot is. Sometimes however, especially if the room is not feature-rich, Rtabmap will localize the robot incorrectly. If that's the case, just use the **2D Pose Estimate** tool at the top of the Rviz window to let Rtabmap know where the robot actually is.

This is the bare minimum needed to get up and running. Take a look at the table below to see how to further customize with other launch file arguments.

| Argument | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | :-----------: |
| robot_model | model type of the Interbotix Locobot such as 'locobot_base' or 'locobot_wx250s' | "" |
| robot_name | name of the robot (could be anything but defaults to 'locobot') | "locobot" |
| use_lidar | if true, the RPLidar node is launched | false |
| show_lidar | set to true if the lidar is installed on the robot; this will load the lidar related links to the 'robot_description' parameter | $(arg use_lidar) |
| use_rviz | launches Rviz | false |
| localization | if true, Rtabmap opens in localization only mode; if false, Rtabmap open in SLAM mode | false |
| rtabmap_args | arguments that should be passed to the **rtabmap** node; note that these arguments are in addition to the arguments already specified in the *rtabmap_default_args* argument in the [xslocobot_nav.launch](launch/xslocobot_nav.launch) file | "" |
| use_rtabmapviz | whether or not to use Rtabmap's Visualization tool; it's not really necessary as Rtabmap already has Rviz display plugins | false |
| rtabmapviz_args | arguments to pass to the Rtabmapviz visualization node | "" |
| database_path | location where all the mapping data Rtabmap collects should be stored | "~/.ros/rtabmap.db" |
| camera_tilt_angle | desired angle [rad] that the D435 camera should be tilted when doing SLAM or localization | 0.2618 |
| launch_driver | true if the *xslocobot_control.launch* file should be launched - set to false if you would like to run your own version of this file separately | true |

## Troubleshooting Notes

##### Time out waiting for transform...
When starting the Nav Stack (either when continuing a map or just doing localization) on your robot, you may see some warnings appear in the terminal. For example...
```
Timed out waiting for transform from locobot_wx200/base_footprint to map to become available before running costmap, tf error: canTransform: target_frame map does not exist.. canTransform returned after 0.100567 timeout was 0.1
```
The reason this appears is because no map is being supplied to the navigation stack. The reason for *that* is because it takes Rtabmap a few seconds to generate the map from its database (which could be hundreds of megabytes). As such, this warning can be safely ignored assuming it stops once Rtabmap gets the map out.

##### Rejected Loop Closure
When starting the Nav stack or during mapping, you may see the following warning appear (or similar) in the terminal...
```
Rtabmap.cpp:2533::process() Rejected loop closure 694 -> 773: Not enough inliers 0/20 (matches=0) between 694 and 772
```
Similar to the first warning, this can be ignored if it only shows up a few times at node startup. It just means that Rtabmap has failed to determine where the robot is in the map. If you're mapping too quickly, this warning can also appear, so slow down a bit.
