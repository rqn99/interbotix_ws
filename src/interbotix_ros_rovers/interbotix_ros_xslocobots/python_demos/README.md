# Interbotix X-Series Locobot Python API Demos

## Overview
This directory showcases various ways of using the [Interbotix Python Locobot Module](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_toolboxes/blob/main/interbotix_xs_toolbox/interbotix_xs_modules/src/interbotix_xs_modules/locobot.py) (click the link to see the fully documented code). Simply put, this API was created so that users with little to no ROS experience would still have the ability to control any Interbotix Locobot supported by the *interbotix_xs_sdk*. Specifically, the API also allows a user to make an arm go to desired end-effector poses or follow Cartesian trajectories. This last feature was made possible by the [Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control Code Library](https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics) created at Northwestern University. It also allows the ability to move the camera pan/tilt servos and send velocity commands to the base.

For the API to work, the arm and pan/tilt joints must be set to 'position' control and the gripper set to 'PWM' control (conveniently, these are the default configs in the *interbotix_xslocobot_control* package). Furthermore, the API assumes that all the arm-joint motors' [Drive Mode](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xm430-w350/#drive-mode) registers are set to [Time-Based-Profile](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xm430-w350/#profile-velocity112) (this is also the default configuration). In a nutshell, this setting makes it very easy for you as the user to customize the duration and smoothness of an arm's motion from one pose to the next.

## Structure
![xslocobot_python_demos_flowchart](images/xslocobot_python_demos_flowchart.png)

The Python Locobot module (located in the *interbotix_xs_modules* ROS package) builds on top of the *interbotix_xs_sdk* package. To get familiar with the other nodes in the graph above, look at the various packages READMEs.
- **robot_manipulation** - a ROS node (operating 'behind the scenes') that takes in commands entered via the Python API and publishes data to various ROS topics as necessary. It is not a classic ROS node in the sense that it can't be launched from a ROS launch file or run from the terminal using a `rosrun` command. Rather, the Python API module contains a Class that when instantiated, gives the node life. At the completion of a program, the object gets destroyed, killing the node.

## Terminology
<p align="center">

</p>

Before getting started with the Python API, it is important to understand some terminology. First off, end-effector poses are specified from */<robot_name>/ee_gripper_link* (a.k.a the 'Body' frame) to */<robot_name>/arm_base_link* (a.k.a the 'Space' frame). In the code documentation, this transform is knows as **T_sb** (i.e. the transform that specifies the 'Body' frame 'b' in terms of the 'Space' frame 's'). It goes without saying that the 'red' axis is the 'X-frame', the 'green' axis is the 'Y-frame', and the 'blue' axis is the 'Z-frame'. The way this information is stored is via a transformation matrix as shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img width="auto" height="100%" src="images/transformation_matrix.png">
</p>

In the image above, the first three rows and three columns define a 3-dimensional rotation matrix that describes the orientation of the 'Body' frame with respect to the 'Space' frame. On the other hand, the first three rows and the fourth column of the matrix represent the translational position (i.e. xyz) of the 'Body' frame with respect to the 'Space' frame. Finally, the fourth row of the matrix is always [0 0 0 1] for matrix multiplication purposes. Besides for seeing **T_sb** in the code documentation, you will also see **T_sd**. The main difference between these two transforms is that **T_sb** defines the current end-effector pose whereas **T_sd** defines the desired ('d') end-effector pose with respect to the 'Space' frame. If using the `set_ee_pose_matrix` function, **T_sd** is what you should be specifying.

Some of us though prefer not to think in terms of transformation or rotation matrices. That's where the `set_ee_pose_components` function comes in handy. In this function, you define **T_sd** in terms of the components it represents - specifically the x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw of the 'Body' frame with respect to the 'Space' frame (where x, y, and z are in meters, and roll, pitch and yaw are in radians). If using an arm with less than 6dof, the 'yaw' parameter, even if specified, will always be ignored.

As an FYI, if you set two end-effector poses in a row (with either of the functions discussed above) where the only difference is that the 'x' component is shifted by 0.2 meters, the end-effector will NOT follow a straight-line path, but rather a curved one. This makes it difficult to perform movements that are 'orientation-sensitive' (like carrying a small cup of water without spilling). To get around this, there is the `set_ee_cartesian_trajectory` function! This function essentially defines waypoints that the end-effector should follow as it travels from its current pose to the desired pose such that it moves in a straight line. The number of waypoints generated depends on the duration of the trajectory (a.k.a **moving_time**) along with the period of time between waypoints (a.k.a **wp_period**). For example, if the whole trajectory should take 2 seconds and the waypoint period is 0.05 seconds, there will be a total of 2/0.05 = 40 waypoints. Besides for these function arguments, there is also **wp_moving_time** and **wp_accel_time**. Respectively, these parameters refer to the duration of time it should take for the arm joints to go from one waypoint to the next, and the time it should spend accelerating while doing so. Together, they help to perform smoothing on the trajectory. If the values are too small, the joints will do a good job following the waypoints but the motion might be very jerky. If the values are too large, the motion will be very smooth, but the joints will not do a good job following the waypoints.

There are two other things to note about the `set_ee_cartesian_trajectory` function. The first thing is that this function accepts *relative* values only. So if the end-effector is located at xyz = [0.2, 0, 0.2], and then the function is called with 'z=0.3' as the argument, the new pose will be xyz = [0.2, 0, 0.5]. The second thing is that end-effector poses are defined with respect to a virtual frame called **T_sy**. This frame has the exact same x, y, z, roll, and pitch as the 'Space' frame. However, it contains the 'yaw' of the 'Body' frame. Thus, if the end-effector is located at xyz = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2] with respect to the 'Space' frame, this converts to xyz = [0.2828, 0, 0.2] with respect to the **T_sy** frame. Now, if I want the end-effector to move 0.3 meters along the X-axis of **T_sy**, I can call the function with 'x=0.3' as the argument, and it will move to xyz = [0.5828, 0, 0.2] with respect to **T_sy**. This way, you only have to think in 1 dimension. However, if the end-effector poses were defined in the 'Space' frame, then relative poses would have to be 2 dimensional. For example, the pose equivalent to the one above with respect to the 'Space' frame would have to be defined as xyz = [0.412, 0.412, 0.2].

Thus, in my opinion, the best way to control an arm from its Sleep pose is as follows:
- Command the arm to go to its Home pose or any end-effector pose where 'y' is defined as 0 (so that the upper-arm link moves out of its cradle)
- Command the waist joint until the end-effector is pointing in the desired direction
- Command the end-effector using the `set_ee_cartesian_trajectory` function as many times as necessary to do a task (pick, place, pour, etc...)
- Repeat the above two steps as necessary
- Command the arm to its Home pose
- Command the arm to its Sleep pose

Note, that if using a 6dof arm, it is also possible to use the `set_ee_cartesian_trajectory` function to move the end-effector along the 'Y-axis' of **T_sy** or to perform 'yaw' motion. One other thing to note is that the end-effector should not be pitched past +/- 89 degrees as that can lead to funky things happening... In any event, feel free to refer to the [bartender](bartender.py) script to see the above method put into action.

## Usage
To get started, open up a terminal and type (assuming the **locobot_wx250s** is being launched with the lidar shown but not active)...

```
roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_control xslocobot_python.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx250s show_lidar:=true
```

Note, that if you want to test out your Dynamixel-related code first on a [simulated](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_core/tree/main/interbotix_ros_xseries/interbotix_xs_sdk#overview) robot, you can type...

```
roslaunch interbotix_xslocobot_control xslocobot_python.launch robot_model:=locobot_wx250s show_lidar:=true use_sim:=true
```

In another terminal, navigate to this directory and type...
```
python bartender.py        # python3 bartender.py if using ROS Noetic
```
You should observe the robot pick up a virtual bottle (from behind a virtual bar), rotate so that the end-effector is facing the opposite direction, pour a virtual drink (on the virtual bar), then place the 'bottle' down, and go to its Sleep pose.

The other scripts work in a similar fashion, but you must make sure to change the robot name in the file to the arm you have. You might also have to adjust the commanded poses/trajectories if working with smaller arm models (like the PincherX 100) as some of them might by physically unattainable. To make things easier, each script also outlines the commands necessary to get the robot moving!
